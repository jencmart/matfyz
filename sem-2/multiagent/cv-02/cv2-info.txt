## Prisoners dilema
Defect X Cooperate
Two players


* TFT strategy Tits for Tats ... 1. start Cooperate ; then always replicate other player action from last turn
* AD strategy
* AC strategy


Let us have this prisoners dilemma:
   D   C
C  3   0

D  5   1

....which combinations of streategies are interesting ( first x second player )
TFT x TFT ... 300 x 300

TFT x AC ... 300 x 300

AD x AC .. 500 x 0

TFT x AD ... 0+99  5+99
              99    104

AD x AD .. 100 x 100


... let us now calculate some probability
AD : p*AD + (1-p)*TFT
....
...


TFT: p AD + (1-p)TFT

.....
it leads to that playing TFT leads in general to better results
