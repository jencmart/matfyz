This is a problem solution kit for the labs exercises of the MFF CUNI
course on "Algoritmy a jejich implementace".

The test images are not part of the repository, download them separately at
	http://kam.mff.cuni.cz/~aim/aim-testfiles.tar.gz

The most interesting file is exercise.c, which is to provide the exercise()
routine that performs the appropriate image transformation.  When submitting
your solution, submit ONLY THE FILE exercise.c (with exercise() function,
without any main()) using aim-submit. To test, run aim-test TASK exercise.c
inside aim-kit directory with your exercise.c.

Run `make` to build the binary executable: this will create two files:

	aim-opt - optimized version suitable for production use
	aim-dbg - unoptimized version suitable for debugging

Run the binary as:
	./aim-opt 1 test1024.pbm output.pbm
	display output.pbm

If you want to pass custom compiler flags, run it e.g. as:
	make MYCFLAGS="-DLALALA ..."

To get annotated assembly source, run `make exercise.s`.


In order to benchmark your code the same way we will, run `make benchmark`.
This will internally run your subroutine multiple times in row on the same
image, however you must not take advantage of this in your code.
